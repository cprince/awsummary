AWStats integration for OJS 2.3.1

version 0.6 slightly cleaned up and more robust
version 0.5 is MVP Minimal Viable Plugin

Scripts directory contains the SQL to hold the data and the PHP to process the AWStats data files.

Do not store the scripts directory in a web accessible place. Instead move it to an area from which you normally run utilites, like /usr/local

To be clear, move and delete the scripts directory before adding this to your OJS installation.
